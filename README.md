# webots_trajectory_gen  
## brief
### This repo is to play with a KUKA kr6 900 robot in webots, the repo insists of robot forward kinematic and inverse kinematic(close-form solution). Matlab program needs to be transform into python program to run in webots(because it could be faster), after testing, python program will be transformed into C++ program to run in a real robot.
